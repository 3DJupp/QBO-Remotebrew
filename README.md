# Controlling an IOT enabled Coffeemaker

Inspired by michaelhenningersrb I decided to get in touch with QBO, a coffeemachine equiped with WiFi, Voice and App control.

**[ wiki from michaels repo ]( https://github.com/michaelhenningersrb/home-assistant-config/wiki )**

The machine will listen on port 443, using self signed certificates.
